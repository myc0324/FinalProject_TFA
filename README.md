# Tools for Analytics Final Project
* This project delivers some analyses of `311_Service_Requests_2020.csv` with 11101 as target ZIP.
* Top10.ipynb figures out the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in the chosen ZIP. Variable `top10` reports this with a pandas.Series.
* Parking.ipynb judges whether illegal parking incidents account for a higher proportion of all 311 incidents in the chosen ZIP than the entire data. Variable `higher_parking_proportion` returns `True` if it's true and returns `False` otherwise.
